# Observed and Predicted Water Use over the Jordan River Basin
Calista Moore | CSU WR514 Final Project | May 1, 2022

# Introduction
This page describes the use of WaPOR data from the Jordan River Basin from over a decade to analyze historic changes and predict future trends in land use, precipitation, and evapotranspiration and interception.

## Defining the Issue
Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries in the world, with major aqueducts drying up and the government in search of alternative water sources to sustain its growing population (FAO and IHE Delft, 2020). Jordan houses large refugee communities and its economy relies on tourism and agricultural exports, including water-intensive crops of rice and almonds as well as dairy and poultry farms, speeding up the depletion of its water resources (U.S. Department of Commerce, n.d.). Poor communities face days without water supply and private water companies have no incentive to close the gap due to the growing cost of water (United States Government, 2018). Alternative sources of water have been identified, including major desalination and reuse projects, but demand continues to rise and outpace new water sources. The Jordan River Basin is a major source of water for the country. 
<b><i>Jordan's worsening water shortage will have growing impacts on major sectors of the economy in addition to the wellbeing of its citizens and refugees.</b></i>

This project will assess how land use, precipitation, and evapotranspiration and interception have changed in Jordan from 2009-2020 and predict how Jordanâ€™s water resources will change in the future based on trends from available data, especially for farmers and cities.

## Research Questions and Objectives
The following research questions are posed:
1. How have land use, precipitation, and evapotranspiration and interception changed from 2009-2020 over the Jordan River Basin?
2. How might these historic trends predict future changes, especially for farms and cities?

# Methods

## Description of Datasets
Three datasets are downloaded from the FAO WaPOR catalog (FAO, 2020) for the years 2009-2020:

### Annual Actual Evpotranspiration and Interception (ETI<sub>a</sub>)
ETI<sub>a</sub> is the sum of the soil evaporation, canopy transpiration, and evaporation from rainfall intercepted by leaves (https://wapor.apps.fao.org/catalog/WAPOR_2/2/L2_AETI_A). The units are in millimeters for a given year and the spatial resolution is at the 100m scale. The geographic coordinate system used is the WGS84 and the data is available for download in a raster format for 2009-2021. The data are from the Proba-V satellite until December 2019, at which this satellite was decommissioned and the data are replaced by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission.

### Annual Land Cover (LC)
LC is an experimental land cover dataset at the 100m scale using the WGS84 coordinate reference system (https://wapor.apps.fao.org/catalog/WAPOR_2/2/L2_LCC_A). The data are available for download in raster format for 2009-2020. The data is from MODIS using Copernicus training data. The land cover classification system was developed by the FAO and includes 25 possible classes.

### Annual Precipitation (PCP)
PCP is the total annual precipitation derived from summing daily data in units of millimeters (https://wapor.apps.fao.org/catalog/WAPOR_2/1/L1_PCP_A). This dataset is at the 5,000km scale using the WGS84 coordinate reference system and is available for download for the years 2009-2021, though daily or monthly data are updated approximately 5 days after observation. The source of the data is the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS).

## Description of Study Area
The Jordan River Basin spans five countries: west Jordan, east Israel, northeast Egypt, southeast Lebanon, and southwest Syria. This includes the Dead Sea and the shared Jordan River, which begins in Lebanon and serves as a border between Lebanon and Syria as well as Israel and Jordan. Though the Jordan River does not reach Egypt, its basin extends into the northeast corner of the country.
